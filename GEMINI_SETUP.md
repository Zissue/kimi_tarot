- Rate limit is exceeded
- API is temporarily unavailable
- Network issues occur

## Advanced Usage

### Maximizing AI Quality

**Tips for Better Interpretations**:

1. **Ask Clear Questions**: Be specific about what you want guidance on
   - ‚úÖ Good: "What should I focus on to improve my career?"
   - ‚ùå Vague: "Tell me about my life"

2. **Provide Context**: The more specific your question, the more tailored the response
   - ‚úÖ "How can I resolve conflict with my colleague?"
   - ‚úÖ "What energy should I bring to my upcoming interview?"

3. **Use Different Spreads**: 
   - Single Card: Quick daily guidance
   - Three Card: Temporal perspective (Past, Present, Future)
   - Relationship: Focus on connections and partnerships
   - Celtic Cross: Comprehensive life reading

### Comparing Interpretations

Want to see the difference? Try the same reading with and without AI:
1. Do a reading with AI enabled
2. Clear your API key in Settings
